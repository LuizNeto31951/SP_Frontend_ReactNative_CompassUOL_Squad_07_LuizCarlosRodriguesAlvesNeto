# Challenge 1 - Blog 

Challenge made for the SP scholarship program - Hybrid Mobile Journey (React Native) - AWS Cloud Context - Compass UOL

## Features

The blog page has an initial screen with a main post made by myself and some other posts randomly generated using DummyJson fake-api, those posts
send you to a new page generated specifically for it, there are also random comments being generated for each post and you can leave your own comment as well.

The site is responsive for mobile, changing aspects of the site and removing the header nav-bar and creating a burger menu for the nav aswell.
